      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        We’re all about meeting your needs, solving your problems, and growing your business. We believe that a company
        and website are more than a completed checklist. That's why Maven Consulting focuses on building an identity
        and soul for your business. As human beings, we want to do business with companies that share our beliefs and
        values. This is why Apple has a cult following. They embody a set of values that certain people—both customers
        and employees—identify with.
        Combine that with a quality product and website, and you have a strong business.

        <!--
          We focus on
        building online brands and getting results for our clients.
          Being cool
        doesn’t mean a thing if we can’t produce results. So instead of trying to convince others
        that we are one of those cool consulting companies.
          We were
        founded under the philosophy that drinking gourmet coffee or wearing ultra-hip sandals wasn’t the way to
        impress
        clients. -->

      A website is an online representation of your business. It connects you with your audience and builds your
      client lists. We help you
      communicate the benefits of your products and services, and unlock the untapped potential of your business.
      Building a platform generates new leads, reflects your brand's values, and allows access across all devices. All
      while looking great, and loading fast. -->

    <!-- <h3>Why Choose Us?</h3>
    <p>
      We know you’ve been shopping around for developers. You already know you have a lot of other web development
      companies competing for your business. So why choose us? Simple! Because when you choose Maven Consulting,
      you’re
      dealing
      with experts who not only know about technology and design, we also know about marketing. We understand your
      business. And we know exactly how to turn pixels on your screen into profits in your pocket.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>We're Committed to Good Communication</h3>
    <p>
      We’re a team who values customer service above all else. You can be assured of always getting a response,
      whether you call or email us.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>You’ll Get Feature-rich User-friendly Designs</h3>
    <p>
      You’ve seen websites and applications that were beautiful, but awfully hard to navigate or use. And on the flip
      side, you’ve no doubt seen user-friendly sites that looked like they were made in 1995. When you work with us,
      you don’t have to pick one or the other. We’ll make sure your websites are both visually stunning and amazingly
      intuitive.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>No Hidden Fees</h3>
    <p>
      When we give you a quote, that’s what you’ll pay. You’ll never be surprised by hidden fees.
