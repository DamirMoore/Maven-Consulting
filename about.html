    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div class="about-us-body">
      <p>
        We’re all about meeting your needs, finding solutions to your problems, and growing your business. We were
        founded under the philosophy that drinking gourmet coffee or wearing ultra-hip sandals wasn’t the way to impress
        clients. Being cool doesn’t mean a thing if we can’t produce results. So instead of trying to convince others
        that we were one of those cool, ego-driven consulting firms, we instead focused on building online brands – and
        results – for our clients.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>Why Choose Us?</h3>
      <p>
        We know you’ve been shopping around for developers. You already know you have a lot of other web development
        companies competing for your business. So why choose us? Simple! Because when you choose Maven Consulting,
        you’re
        dealing
        with experts who not only know about technology and design, we also know about marketing. We understand your
        business. And we know exactly how to turn pixels on your screen into profits in your pocket.
      </p>

      <br>
      <h3>We're Committed to Good Communication</h3>
      <p>
        We’re a team who values customer service above all else. You can be assured of always getting a response,
        whether you call or email us.
      </p>

      <br>
      <h3>You’ll Get Feature-rich User-friendly Designs</h3>
      <p>
        You’ve seen websites and applications that were beautiful, but awfully hard to navigate or use. And on the flip
        side, you’ve no doubt seen user-friendly sites that looked like they were made in 1995. When you work with us,
        you don’t have to pick one or the other. We’ll make sure your websites are both visually stunning and amazingly
        intuitive.
      </p>

      <br>
      <h3>No Hidden Fees</h3>
      <p>
        When we give you a quote, that’s what you’ll pay. You’ll never be surprised by hidden fees.
